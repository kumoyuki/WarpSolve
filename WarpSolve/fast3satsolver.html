    <h1>Citizen Scientist 4 - NP Fortune and 3SAT Glory</h1>

    <h2>The Problem and Its Reward</h2>
    <p>Here's twenty numbers: 3 6 10 12 17  19 34 52 51 64   73 77 81 92 105   117 118 121 125.  Which of them, if any, if added up, would total 169?  If that feels like a hard 
        problem to solve, you're not alone.  This problem is called SUBSET-SUM, and it is one of many in a class of problems, called decision problems, that are notoriously difficult to exactly solve.  
        It seems like you have to go through all the combinations to do it, while you might think computers should have no problems with that, progressively larger lists of 
        numbers have too many combinations for computers to solve by brute force alone.  
    </p>
    <p>There's many examples of these decision problems. There's Travelling Salesman - what's the shortest route to tour some number of cities.  There's the cutting problem - if I need 
        some pieces of board cut up, what's the most efficient way to get the pieces that I need.  Even the cryptography used to ensure the identity of a website or protect a program from tampering, 
        is thought to be related.  It turns out that researchers, Cook and Levin, showed that all of these problems are related in a fundamental way. If you could create a routine to solve
        any one of them, it could be used to solve them all.  
    </p>
    <p>No one has done so, and many serious computer scientists actually think it is impossible.  There's a lot of motivation to come up with something.  Not only for science, but for sheer money - such 
        a discovery would open the door to computer programs that could do things we think of today as impossible. And, there's big prizes as well.  There's a shot at the Nobel, there's the <a href="http://www.claymath.org/millennium/P_vs_NP/">a million dollar reward</a>,
        and numerous other smaller awards and recognitions in the industry.
    </p>
    <p>Wait... did someone say million dollar reward?  What's a Citizen Scientist to Do?  Dang I have to pay my electric bill - some coin would surely help!</p>

    <h2>Introduction to 3SAT</h2>
    <p>Money money money, I dream of the sound of clinking krugerands as my wife and I pile the kids into an inflatable pirate ship sailing underneath the sprays of my pool.  
    But how do I get there?  First, we have to pick a problem.   As I was writing, there's a bunch of different kinds problems that are related, and all you have to do is write a routine that can solve one and 
        in such a way that it can be re-used to solve other problems.  For this prize quest, I am starting with 3SAT, largely because it is most mappable to an idea 
        I'd already dabbled with.
    </p>    

    <p>3SAT is pretty simple to describe. Those of you with some computer experience know boolean expressions.  We might write if ((A or B or C) and (X or !A)), to say, if this condition 
        is true, then do something. Satisfiability or SAT, is the opposite of that. We would look at that expression, and try to figure out, what variable assignments would make that true.
        That expression, with its variables figured out, is said to be "satisfied", get it?  These complexity problems all have this simple pattern - one is, doing something simple, like 
        add up a few numbers, evaluate a boolean expression, and then an opposite, which is thought to be hard. 3SAT is just a case of satisfiability - technically it means Satisfiability for expressions 
        in the 3 Conjunctive Normal Form, but really, just think some variable number of clauses anded together,  and each clause has three variables in it, or'd together. 
    </p>

    <p>3SAT means solve expressions that look this:</p>
    <pre>
        (A or B or C) and (!C or D or E) 
        (A or B or !D) and (!D or E or F) and (!B or A or F)
        (A or D or !E) and (!F or B or C) and (!B or !A or F) and (!D or E or F) and (!D or !E or !B)
    </pre>
