* DNF or CNF and conversion from General SAT
** SAT in general has many answers for a given constraint set
** DNF is && | && | && = OR of ANDs
** CNF is || & || & || = AND of ORs
** Complexity
*** General SAT is NP complete
**** NP-completeness only refers to the run-time of the worst case instances. Many of the instances that occur in practical applications can be solved much more quickly
*** conversion from general SAT to DNF is NP complete
*** 3SAT is on CNF and is NP complete
**** e^n where n is the number of disjuncts 
*** 3SAT on DNF is P
*** conversion from SAT to 3CNF
**** is polynomial time
**** preserves number of answers by "Cook's Reduction"
*** conversion from SAT to 3DNF
**** is exponential time
**** DNF is solvable in polynomial time
